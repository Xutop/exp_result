Network structure:
	Here we adopt two types of network: 
	The shallow one has three convolutional layers with the number of output 32, 64, 128, respectively and two fully connected layers which both have an output neurons of 1024;
	The deep one has nine convolutional layers divided into three stacks with each stack having the same number of output 32, 64, 128 and two fully connected layers.
	All convolutional layers have the same kernel size of 3 and we use max pooling of size 2, stride 2, at the end of each convolution or stack layer.
data set:
	MNIST,CIFAR10,CIFAR100
